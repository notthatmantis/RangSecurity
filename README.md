<h1 style="font-size:60px;"> Rang - Security for Everyone </h1>
---
<h2 style="font-size:30px;"> Project Description </h2>
Rang aims to take something that is overpriced and exploited, and make it accessible to everyone. Here at Rang, our mission is to help make information available and accessible to everyone, while doing so at an affordable price. We draw our inspirations from Ring Doorbells, and with our app, you can have equivalent power for a fraction of the cost.
<br> <br>
Rang Cameras are an affordable security feature that have built in motion detection and human verification systems that can access and capture your computer's camera(s) when any motion is detected. When our app is active, it will be able to send you a text message or email informing you of the security breach at your computer and let you see it in real time. Additional features include the ability to start and stop the feed, capture a photo, and toggle our security mode. Every Photo you take can be accessed locally and will *hopefully* be accessable from the cloud in the future.
